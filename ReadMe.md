#Gilded Rose - Refactoring Kata#

All versions of the Gilded Rose Kata in Cpp I found on GitHub come without
a complete set of test cases. So I completed the test cases to provide a good
starting point for the refactoring.

As base to lift of I used the code from the [repository of Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/cpp).
I translated the RSpec specs of the ruby version into GMock test cases.

Note that I also slightly changed the GildedRose class in order to make
creation and obtaining the item under test a little bit easier.

Check out the branch __starting-point-for-refactoring__ to start refactoring.
